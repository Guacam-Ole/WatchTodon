# Who am I?
I am a watchdog (or maybe a watchelephant?üêò) that checks if any other account has gone silent. It needs your commands to work properly just by using Mastodn statusses. 


# Why am I here
@guacamole@chaos.social has written a few bots, some of them by request he does not really use himself and so is not always aware if something is wrong. Monitoring Docker or logs does not always help. So this is why I am here to assist.

# AI?
Proud to be AI - free. This is just a simple tool that uses the Mastodon api anyways.


# Mentioning
When telling me what account to monitor (see next image) you can ALWAYS give me the full account `@account@mastodon.social` or leave the (at): `account@mastodon.social`

the difference is that when mentioning the account properly with "√¶" the account owner will also get a Notification. If you want to monitor real persons and not bots that might be a bit annoying
